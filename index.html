                    <p> I'm always open to the idea of learning and trying new things and facing new problems everyday. I don't enjoy working on the same thing over and over again whereas i like to go outside of my comfort zone and solve other problems. On
                        my 4th year i decided to become a part-time student and explore that area before I finish my studies. </p>

                    <h5> <strong> Public speaking </strong> </h5>
                    <p> I consider myself to be a very open and extrovert person and have had the oportunity to do 2 presentations at FEUP's main auditorium for 2 different courses as well as take part in some academic traditions which helped me develop that
                        component.

                    <p> I believe in teamwork. We can't make it outhere on our own and everybody needs help sometimes. I'm always happy to help any friend or colleage in need in any way i can as i expect to be helped as well when I don't know something about
                        some topic. </p>

                    <p> During meetings i try my best to always listen to other people's current tasks and issues and suggest ideas for their implementation or new features that should be added. During the <strong>SCRUM</strong> meetings at Jumpseller or
                        at some courses at FEUP where we practiced the <strong>SCRUM</strong> methodology, i listened to other people's tasks and learned to help them on their struggles and ask for help myself.</p>

                        used before in a fast way. </p>
