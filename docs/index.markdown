Welcome to my personal website.

My name is André Fernandes and I'm a **Portuguese Machine Learning Engineer** with a MSc in Informatics and Computer Engineering at the **Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto**.

I come from **Vila Nova de Famalicão**, a city located in **Braga** district.

In here, you'll find personal and **professional information** about myself as well as some tech/computer-science related posts that I enjoy writing about some things I've learned through my work/study experience.

Feel free to **contact me** through the provided social media or via e-mail.
