- Recently, I finished an online course on **Udemy** called [Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/). It was my first course on Udemy, taught by **Frank Kane**, founder of **Sundog Education** and I thought it was a very nice hands-on and practical course on **machine learning** using **Python**.
- It attempts to **cover as much ground** as possible, **not going too deep** on each topic but the contents explained there were **understandable** and it is a **good way** to start and get an initial grasp of Machine Learning. I've previously worked with Machine Learning, so not all the concepts were new to me, but it was a very interesting experience nonetheless.
- The course's final project was writing code to run some algorithms on a mammographic masses dataset for classification purposes, that is to detect breast cancer, which was a simple way of implementing some of the things I learned in the course. The code is hosted [here](https://github.com/Marko50/udemy-machine-learning-data-science-deep-learning-python).
