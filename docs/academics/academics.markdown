#### Primary, Basic and Secondary Education (2003-2015)
- Escola da Avenida and Externato Delfim Ferreira was where I did my basic and high school education and picked the *Sciences and Technologies* course. These schools are located in a village called **Riba D'Ave**, in the north of **Portugal**.

#### University (2015-2020)
- I applied and got accepted to the **Informatics and Computer Engineering course** at the **Faculty of Engineering University of Porto** which was my 1st choice.
I have a **MSc** in this course.
I finished the course with a **GPA of 15** (0-20) and in my MSc's thesis, I made a **Software Library for Stream-Based Recommender Systems**, called [increc](https://pypi.org/project/increc/) whose implementation and report document were graded with a **19** mark.

#### Other certifications

**English Certifications** (2008-2012)

- I registered in a English Institute in Vila Nova de Famalic√£o where I learned how to write, speak and listen to the english language and comprehend it better. It helped me get my **First Certificate in English (FCE)** which gets me at C1 level in English.

**Online Courses** (2020 - Now)

I've recently started taking online courses and started by using the **Udemy** platform.

 - The first course I've completed is named **Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python** by **Frank Kane**, which is a very useful practical, cut-to-the-chase course for everyone wanting to start and get an initial grasp in Machine Learning.
