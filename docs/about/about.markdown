- I'm a **late 90's guy (1997)** who enjoys Portuguese hip/hop songs as well as rock and techno music. I've always loved technology, namely computers, and I'm a devoted member of a secret society called **Linux Master Race**. The freedom **Linux** gives me is beyond comparison and I really like experimenting with different distros.

- I absolutely **love horror films** because I believe that, when they're good movies, they over exceed the expectations of the general public, but even when they're poorly done, they are so bad that they're good to laugh at.

- I also **enjoy watching anime** but avoid reading manga, so pardon me If you're reading this and you're Japanese.

- I **love comedy shows and comedians** but also believe that simplicity comedy brings to real complex problems does not help solve them. Instead, it gives us relief from the problem itself. What I mean is, making a joke about a complex issue, does not help solve the problem, but at least it gives us something to laugh at.

- I grew up watching and liking **Sport Lisboa e Benfica** (a Portuguese football club) but as I grow older I'm losing interest in football due to the way it's being managed in my country.

- I believe in **economic freedom**, **free-market**, and **liberalism** and very I'm very opposed to **cancel-culture**.

- **My friends** like to make fun of me saying that if I make it the prime minister of Portugal, they'll emigrate and leave the country but the joke is on them because they'll do it regardless of that.

- I've just found out **I'm not fond of writing about myself** since this reminds me of English classes when I was in 5th grade.
